## Description



### How to run


###Requirements:

To be able to play the game, it is necessary to change the path of the different images, that will be displayed throughout the game. This can be done in `src/display_image.asm`, where the paths are inserted at the beginning of the document, separated by a slash `/`.

Specify which file need to be used to run your program:
e.g.
To run the game, open `src/main.asm`in [Rars](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars). 
To get started, the _Bitmap Display_ and _Keyboard Simulator_ must be configured. To do so, the display width of the _Bitmap Display_ needs to be set to **256 pixels** and the height of the Display is set to **128 pixels**. Both tools are then connected to the program.

Now two Players can start playing the game. 

###Game instructions 
The two Players use different keys on the keybard to conrtol their paddles.

## Files
Describe the content of each file of your application: e.g.

`src/main.asm`: Main file of the program in which the game flow is located

`src/images`: Folder containing images, displayed on the screen, while the game is running

`src/featureA.asm` # A specific feature called in main

test/test1.asm - test9.asm # 9 unit tests for featureA
